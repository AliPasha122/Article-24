Inflation poses persistent challenges to global economies, necessitating novel approaches
beyond traditional monetary policies. This research proposes innovative strategies including
Dynamic Digital Currency Adjustment (DDCA), Decentralized Autonomous Supply Chains
(DASCs), Inflation-Indexed Universal Basic Income (IIUBI), AI-Driven Price Monitoring
Systems, and Community-Based Local Currency Systems. These methods leverage advanced
technologies such as blockchain, AI, and IoT to enhance economic stability and mitigate the
high cost of living.
